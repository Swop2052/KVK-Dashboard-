A PROJECT ON
Agrisys: A Digital Work Management and Reporting Platform for Krishi Vigyan Kendra
aims to bridge this gap by creating a fully functional, responsive, and user-friendly website for the Krishi Vigyan Kendra located at Jalgaon Jamod. The primary goal is to provide a centralized platform to share information related to agricultural technologies, training programs, Front Line Demonstrations (FLDs), operational area details, expert guidance, achievements, and farmer-centric services.
The website is developed using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for responsive design. JavaScript is employed to add interactivity such as dynamic forms, login validations, modals, and navigation transitions. The structure is modular and scalable, allowing easy updates and maintenance. The user interface focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and professionalism, with smooth animations and hover effects for enhanced user experience.
